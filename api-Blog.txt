one site just READ to show the published post

one site to CREATE DEL AND UPDATE that has all the database store post unpublished/published
		that can be edited by owner of the posts and published from there (auth stuff here)
		
		
		
API:		
	a login url(think in how mongoDB works to connect the uri just given the db password and 
	username we just do something like that and will give the auth token)
	
	a login url that will give the auth token and every time that the api is called
	a middleware will check if has a valid auth token, just person with the token can modify post
	or something like that
	
	db 
		model
			post = title, time-stamp, text,author/profile_id, comments=[ comments_id,],
									post_instances_id
			post_instance = published:true/false, edit_auth
			
			comments= time-stamp,text,username_comments_id
			username_comments = username,comments=[]
			blog_main_author = 
			need to auth too or something like that
				            fname, lname, age,		
			 							profile description(optional),
			 							post=[]
			 							comments=[],
