# Express Node Blog API

This repository contains the code for a Node.js-based RESTful API for a blog application. The API allows users to create and manage blog posts, interact with comments, and perform user authentication.

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It serves as a practical exercise for building a Node.js-based RESTful API and implementing user authentication. The project is actively maintained and may receive updates and improvements.

## Features

- User registration and login using username and password
- Authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Create, edit, and delete blog posts
- Add comments to blog posts
- Retrieve blog post details, author details, and public posts
- RESTful API design

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js (web framework)
- MongoDB (database)
- Mongoose (object modeling for MongoDB)
- Passport.js (authentication middleware)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- bcrypt (password hashing)
